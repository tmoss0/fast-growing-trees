                        Honeycrisp Apples are one of America’s favorites thanks to their crisp,
                        crunchy exterior and delectably juicy interior. Presenting the perfect
                        balance between sweet and tart, this near-ideal apple brings a whole lot
                        of deliciousness to your backyard. Plus, the Honeycrisp Apple Tree reaches
                        heights of just 14 to 18 feet, making the medium-size tree wonderfully manageable.

                    <h5>Planting & Care</h5>
                    <p>            
                        <strong>1. Planting:</strong> Plant in any area that receives 6 hours of direct sun each day. Well-drained soil is also important for your Honeycrisp. From there, dig a hole that's twice the width of the root ball and just as deep. Then, place the plant, tamp down your soil and water to settle. Finally, mulch around the area to prevent weed growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Watering:</strong> Your Honeycrisp Apple will benefit from a regular watering each week. When the tree is in a dormant state, only provide enough water to keep the soil slightly moistened. As soon as you see newer growth emerging from the tree, you can water whenever the top 2 inches of the soil feels dry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3. Pruning:</strong> Once your tree has become established and is starting to bear fruit, it will need some periodic, moderate pruning. Only prune the tree during times of dormancy, making sure to remove any vigorous, upright stems and weak, damaged or dead branches. Low-hanging, droopy branches should also be removed. Pruning aids production, so it's great for your tree!

                    <h6>When Do I Water My Honeycrisp Apple Tree?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Your Honeycrisp Apple will benefit from a regular watering each week. When the tree is in a dormant state, only provide enough water to keep the soil slightly moistened. As soon as you see newer growth emerging from the tree, you can water whenever the top 2 inches of the soil feels dry.

                    <h6>How to Prune Honeycrisp Apple Trees</h6>
                    <p>
                        Once your tree has become established and is starting to bear fruit, it will need some periodic, moderate pruning. Only prune the tree during times of dormancy, making sure to remove any vigorous, upright stems and weak, damaged or dead branches. Low-hanging, droopy branches should also be removed. Pruning aids production, so it's great for your tree!
